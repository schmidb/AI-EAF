# Business Alignment

This dimension ensures AI engineering initiatives support broader business goals and deliver measurable value. It helps organizations connect AI engineering transformation to strategic business outcomes.

Key aspects include:
- Aligning AI engineering initiatives with business strategy
- Measuring and demonstrating the business value of AI adoption
- Developing metrics for AI-augmented engineering productivity
- Creating business cases for AI engineering investments
- Managing the economics of AI-powered development

## Maturity Model for Business Alignment

### Level 2: Developing
- Basic alignment of AI initiatives with business objectives
- Simple metrics for measuring AI impact
- Initial productivity measures for AI-augmented work
- Basic business justification for AI investments
- Fundamental cost tracking for AI tools

### Level 3: Defined
- Clear alignment between AI strategy and business goals
- Comprehensive framework for measuring business value
- Defined metrics for AI engineering productivity
- Structured business cases for AI investments
- Formal approach to managing AI economics

### Level 4: Managed
- Strategic integration of AI initiatives with business strategy
- Advanced analytics measuring comprehensive business impact
- Sophisticated productivity measurement framework
- Data-driven business cases with predictive models
- Optimized economic management of AI investments

### Level 5: Optimizing
- AI engineering as a core business differentiator
- Predictive value models guiding strategic decisions
- Transformative productivity measures redefining benchmarks
- AI investments driven by strategic imperative
- AI economics creating competitive advantage
