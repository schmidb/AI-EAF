# People & Skills

This dimension focuses on developing talent strategies, defining new roles, and building AI competencies across engineering teams. It addresses how organizations need to evolve their workforce to thrive in an AI-augmented engineering environment.

Key aspects include:
- Identifying critical AI engineering skills and competencies
- Developing training and upskilling programs
- Creating new roles and career paths for AI-focused engineers
- Balancing AI expertise with domain knowledge
- Managing the transition of roles as AI automates certain tasks

## Maturity Model for People & Skills

### Level 1: Initial/Ad-hoc
- Engineers experiment with AI tools individually based on personal interest
- No formal training or skill development for AI engineering
- Traditional engineering roles with no consideration for AI capabilities
- Limited awareness of AI's potential impact on engineering roles
- No strategy for developing AI competencies

### Level 2: Developing
- Basic training available for select engineers interested in AI tools
- Informal identification of AI champions within teams
- Some recognition of AI skills in performance reviews
- Initial discussions about how roles might evolve with AI
- Basic skills inventory to identify existing AI capabilities

### Level 3: Defined
- Structured training program for AI engineering skills
- Formal definition of AI-related roles and responsibilities
- Clear competency model for AI engineering skills
- Defined career paths that incorporate AI expertise
- Comprehensive talent strategy addressing AI capabilities

### Level 4: Managed
- Advanced skill development programs with specialized tracks
- Data-driven approach to identifying skill gaps and needs
- Established centers of excellence for AI engineering
- Quantitative goals for team AI capabilities
- Strategic talent acquisition and development for AI skills

### Level 5: Optimizing
- Industry-leading expertise in AI engineering practices
- Continuous evolution of roles based on AI capabilities
- Organization serves as thought leader in AI engineering talent
- Innovative approaches to human-AI collaboration
- Next-generation talent strategies that redefine engineering work
