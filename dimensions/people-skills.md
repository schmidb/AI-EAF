# People & Skills

This dimension focuses on transitioning talent from traditional engineering to AI oversight roles, redefining careers, and developing new competencies for an AI-dominated engineering environment. It addresses how organizations need to evolve their workforce to thrive as AI systems increasingly replace traditional engineering functions.

Key aspects include:
- Identifying critical skills for AI oversight and strategic direction
- Developing transition programs for engineers whose roles may be automated
- Creating new roles focused on AI system management and governance
- Balancing technical expertise with ethical and strategic competencies
- Managing the profound workforce transformation as AI capabilities advance

## Maturity Model for People & Skills

### Level 1: Initial/Ad-hoc
- Engineers experiment with AI tools individually based on personal interest
- No formal training or skill development for AI engineering
- Traditional engineering roles with no consideration for AI replacement
- Limited awareness of AI's potential impact on job security
- No strategy for workforce transition as AI capabilities advance

### Level 2: Developing
- Basic training available for select engineers interested in AI tools
- Informal identification of roles at risk of AI automation
- Some recognition of the need for new AI oversight competencies
- Initial discussions about workforce implications of AI advancement
- Basic skills inventory to identify transition opportunities

### Level 3: Defined
- Structured transition program for engineers in at-risk roles
- Formal definition of AI oversight and governance roles
- Clear competency model for human-AI collaboration skills
- Defined career paths that emphasize strategic and oversight functions
- Comprehensive talent strategy addressing workforce transformation

### Level 4: Managed
- Advanced reskilling programs with personalized transition paths
- Data-driven approach to workforce planning and role evolution
- Established centers of excellence for AI governance and oversight
- Quantitative goals for workforce transition and new role development
- Strategic talent acquisition focused on AI oversight capabilities

### Level 5: Optimizing
- Workforce successfully transitioned to AI oversight and strategic roles
- Continuous evolution of human roles as AI capabilities advance
- Organization serves as thought leader in AI-human workforce models
- Innovative approaches to value creation in an AI-dominated environment
- Next-generation talent strategies that redefine the purpose of human engineers

## Implementation Guidance

### Key Initiatives
1. **Workforce Impact Assessment**: Analyze which roles are most vulnerable to AI replacement and when
2. **Transition Program Development**: Create comprehensive pathways for engineers to move to oversight roles
3. **New Role Definition**: Define AI governance, oversight, and strategic roles needed in an AI-dominated environment
4. **Ethical Transition Planning**: Develop responsible approaches to workforce transformation
5. **Strategic Competency Development**: Build capabilities focused on areas where humans will continue to add unique value

### Adaptability Assessment

A critical first step in the People & Skills dimension is assessing the adaptability of your workforce. [AQai](https://www.aqai.io) provides a specialized tool for measuring adaptability in individuals and organizations that serves as an excellent starting point for this dimension.

#### AQai Assessment Benefits
- Measures individual and team adaptability quotient (AQ)
- Evaluates three core dimensions: ability, character, and environment
- Identifies specific adaptability strengths and development areas
- Provides personalized insights and development recommendations
- Helps organizations understand their collective adaptability profile

#### Integration with AI-EAF
The AQai assessment can be used to:
- Establish a baseline of adaptability before AI transformation initiatives
- Identify team members who may excel as AI champions or change agents
- Target specific adaptability skills needed for AI adoption
- Develop personalized learning paths based on adaptability profiles
- Track improvements in adaptability as AI initiatives progress

#### Implementation Steps
1. Deploy the AQai assessment across engineering teams
2. Analyze results to identify adaptability strengths and gaps
3. Incorporate findings into AI skill development plans
4. Create targeted interventions for adaptability improvement
5. Reassess periodically to measure progress

Organizations should consider the AQai assessment as a foundational element of their AI engineering adaptation strategy, particularly in the early stages of maturity development.

### Common Challenges
- Significant anxiety and resistance due to existential threat to traditional roles
- Ethical considerations around workforce reduction and transition
- Identifying which skills will remain valuable as AI capabilities advance
- Developing effective transition programs at the necessary scale and speed
- Managing organizational knowledge transfer from traditional to AI systems

### Metrics and KPIs
- Percentage of workforce successfully transitioned to new roles
- Reduction in traditional engineering positions versus growth in oversight roles
- Time to proficiency in AI oversight and governance capabilities
- Retention rate of high-value talent during transformation
- Employee well-being and satisfaction metrics during transition
- Adaptability quotient (AQ) scores and improvement over time
