- No standardization or governance of AI tool selection
- Limited or no integration with development environments
- No consideration of security implications
- No measurement of tool effectiveness or impact

### Level 2: Developing
- Basic evaluation process for AI coding tools
- Initial standardization of selected tools for pilot teams
- Simple integration with some development environments
- Basic security considerations addressed
- Limited metrics for tool usage and effectiveness

### Level 3: Defined
- Formal evaluation and selection process for AI tools
- Standardized tool set across engineering organization
- Comprehensive integration with development environments
- Established security policies and controls
- Regular measurement of tool effectiveness and impact

### Level 4: Managed
