# Tooling & Stack

This dimension addresses selecting, implementing, and optimizing AI-powered development tools and infrastructure. It guides organizations in building a technology foundation that enables AI-augmented engineering practices.

Key aspects include:
- Evaluating and selecting appropriate AI coding assistants
- Integrating AI tools into existing development environments
- Building infrastructure to support AI-powered development
- Managing the security implications of AI tools
- Measuring and optimizing the effectiveness of AI tooling

## Maturity Model for Tooling & Stack

### Level 1: Initial/Ad-hoc
- Individual developers use publicly available AI coding tools independently
- No standardization or governance of AI tool selection
- Limited or no integration with development environments
- No consideration of security implications
- No measurement of tool effectiveness or impact

### Level 2: Developing
- Basic evaluation process for AI coding tools
- Initial standardization of selected tools for pilot teams
- Simple integration with some development environments
- Basic security considerations addressed
- Limited metrics for tool usage and effectiveness

### Level 3: Defined
- Formal evaluation and selection process for AI tools
- Standardized tool set across engineering organization
- Comprehensive integration with development environments
- Established security policies and controls
- Regular measurement of tool effectiveness and impact

### Level 4: Managed
- Data-driven optimization of AI tool selection and configuration
- Advanced integration creating a cohesive development ecosystem
- Purpose-built infrastructure optimized for AI development
- Sophisticated security controls and monitoring
- Comprehensive analytics on tool usage and business impact

### Level 5: Optimizing
- Continuous innovation in AI tooling strategy
- Seamless human-AI development environment
- Next-generation infrastructure enabling new capabilities
- Industry-leading security practices for AI tools
- Predictive optimization of tooling based on outcomes

## Implementation Guidance
