# Case Study: Early Adoption of AI to Replace Engineering and Operational Roles

Created in April 2025

This case study examines how leading technology companies — Klarna, Shopify, PayPal, ServiceNow and Uber — are proactively
integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to automate tasks traditionally performed by engineers and other professionals.
These initiatives align with the principles of the AI Engineering Adaptation Framework (AI-EAF), which emphasizes
strategic AI integration to enhance efficiency and productivity.

## PayPal: Enhancing Productivity Through AI
PayPal, a leading digital payments company, is leveraging AI to improve engineering productivity and streamline operations:​

* **Productivity Gains**: CEO Dan Schulman reported a 30% increase in productivity within code development teams due to AI integration. ​
* **Workforce Optimization**: In 2024, PayPal announced layoffs affecting 2,500 employees, citing the need to "deploy automation" and "reduce complexity and duplication." ​

These steps reflect PayPal's commitment to integrating AI into its operations, aligning with AI-EAF's principles of enhancing efficiency through technology.

## ServiceNow: Transforming Operations with Agentic AI
ServiceNow, a cloud-based workflow automation platform, is embedding AI across its operations to augment engineering roles and improve productivity:​

* **Productivity Improvements**: CEO Bill McDermott stated that AI agents are currently "saving workers a day a week," with expectations to "save them 2-1/2 days a week" by 2026. ​
* **Workforce Engagement**: 84% of ServiceNow's workforce uses AI daily, with over 25 generative AI use cases in production across various departments, including software engineering, HR, and customer service. ​
* **Role Evolution**: AI is transforming the role of implementation engineers by automating routine tasks, allowing professionals to focus on more strategic activities. ​

ServiceNow's approach demonstrates AI-EAF's emphasis on integrating AI to augment human capabilities and drive operational efficiency.

## Klarna: Leveraging AI to Streamline Operations
Klarna, a prominent fintech company, has embraced AI to optimize its workforce and operations:​

* **Hiring Freeze and Workforce Reduction**: In 2023, Klarna implemented a hiring freeze, leading to a natural reduction in staff from 5,000 to 3,500 employees. The company anticipates further reductions to 2,000 employees as AI capabilities expand.
* **AI-Powered Customer Service**: An AI chatbot now performs the work equivalent to 700 customer service agents, resolving inquiries faster and more efficiently than human counterparts.
* **Expanded AI Applications**: Beyond customer service, Klarna utilizes AI for financial analysis, product development, marketing content creation, and legal document processing, significantly reducing the time and resources required for these tasks. ​
* **Employee Incentives**: Remaining employees are incentivized with more frequent salary increases, reflecting the productivity gains achieved through AI integration. ​

Klarna's strategic approach to AI integration showcases how companies can transform their operational models while maintaining productivity and service quality.

## Shopify: Mandating AI Proficiency Across the Organization
Shopify, a leading e-commerce platform, has made AI proficiency a core requirement for its workforce:​

* **AI as a Baseline Expectation**: CEO Tobi Lütke declared AI usage as "non-optional," requiring employees to integrate AI tools into their daily workflows. ​
* **Performance and Hiring Criteria**: AI competency is now a formal component of performance evaluations and hiring decisions, ensuring that all team members contribute to the company's AI-driven objectives. ​
* **Resource Allocation**: Employees must justify the need for additional resources by demonstrating that tasks cannot be accomplished using AI, promoting a culture of efficiency and innovation. ​

Shopify's mandate demonstrates how organizations can drive cultural change by establishing clear expectations around AI adoption and usage.
