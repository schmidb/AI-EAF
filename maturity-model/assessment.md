# Maturity Assessment Methodology

This document outlines the methodology for assessing an organization's maturity in AI engineering adaptation across the six dimensions of the AI-EAF.

## Assessment Approach

The maturity assessment follows a structured approach:

1. **Preparation**: Identify stakeholders and gather relevant documentation
2. **Data Collection**: Conduct interviews, surveys, and document reviews
3. **Analysis**: Evaluate findings against maturity indicators
4. **Scoring**: Determine maturity level for each dimension
5. **Reporting**: Document findings and recommendations
6. **Planning**: Develop action plans to address gaps

## Assessment Methods

### Stakeholder Interviews

Conduct structured interviews with:
- Engineering leadership
- Development team members
- Product managers
- Operations personnel
- Business stakeholders

Interview questions should align with the maturity indicators for each dimension.

### Documentation Review

Examine relevant documentation:
- Engineering strategy documents
- Tool selection and implementation plans
- Process documentation
- Training materials
- Governance policies
- Performance metrics

### Observation

Where possible, observe:
- Development workflows in action
- Tool usage patterns
- Collaboration practices
- Decision-making processes

### Surveys

Deploy targeted surveys to gather quantitative data on:
- AI tool adoption and usage
- Skill levels and training needs
- Process adherence and effectiveness
- Cultural attitudes toward AI

## Scoring Framework

For each dimension, evaluate the organization against specific maturity indicators and assign a level from 1-5:

| Score | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1     | Initial/Ad-hoc | Experimental, uncoordinated, individual-driven |
| 2     | Developing | Basic integration, limited coordination, emerging awareness |
| 3     | Defined | Structured approach, standardized practices, defined roles |
| 4     | Managed | Data-driven optimization, comprehensive programs, quantitative goals |
| 5     | Optimizing | Full integration, continuous innovation, industry leadership |

## Dimension Weighting

Organizations may choose to weight dimensions based on their strategic priorities. The default approach is equal weighting across all dimensions, but this can be adjusted based on:
- Strategic objectives
- Industry context
- Organizational constraints
- Competitive landscape

## Assessment Frequency

Recommended assessment frequency:
- Initial baseline assessment
- Progress assessment every 6 months
- Comprehensive reassessment annually

## Using Assessment Results

Assessment results should be used to:
- Identify specific improvement opportunities
- Prioritize initiatives based on gaps and impact
- Develop targeted action plans
- Allocate resources effectively
- Track progress over time
- Benchmark against industry peers
