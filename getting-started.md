# Getting Started with AI-EAF

This guide provides a simple onboarding checklist for organizations looking to begin their AI engineering transformation journey using the AI Engineering Adaptation Framework (AI-EAF).

## Quick Start Checklist

### Step 1: Assess Your Current State (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Form a small cross-functional team (engineering, HR, business leadership)
- [ ] Complete the [Initial Assessment Questionnaire](#initial-assessment-questionnaire) below
- [ ] Identify your organization's current maturity level across the six dimensions
- [ ] Document your most critical gaps and immediate opportunities

### Step 2: Build Awareness & Alignment (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Share the [Executive Summary](executive-summary.md) with leadership team
- [ ] Conduct a workshop to discuss AI's potential impact on your engineering organization
- [ ] Identify an executive sponsor for your AI engineering transformation
- [ ] Establish a small working group with representatives from key stakeholder groups

### Step 3: Define Your Initial Focus Areas (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Select 1-2 dimensions from the framework as your starting point (we recommend People & Skills and Tooling & Stack)
- [ ] For each selected dimension, choose 2-3 specific capabilities to develop first
- [ ] Identify a small, low-risk pilot project to test AI-augmented engineering approaches
- [ ] Set clear success metrics for your initial efforts

### Step 4: Create a 90-Day Action Plan (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Define specific actions to develop your selected capabilities
- [ ] Assign clear ownership for each action item
- [ ] Establish a regular cadence for progress reviews (we recommend bi-weekly)
- [ ] Identify required resources and secure necessary approvals

### Step 5: Execute and Learn (90 days)
- [ ] Implement your action plan
- [ ] Document lessons learned and adjust approach as needed
- [ ] Measure progress against your defined success metrics
- [ ] Communicate wins and challenges to broader organization

### Step 6: Expand Your Transformation (Ongoing)
- [ ] Conduct a reassessment using the full [maturity model](maturity-model/README.md)
- [ ] Develop a comprehensive transformation roadmap across all dimensions
- [ ] Establish formal governance for your AI engineering transformation
- [ ] Create a communication plan for the broader organization

## Initial Assessment Questionnaire

Use this simplified questionnaire to quickly assess your organization's current state across the six dimensions of the AI-EAF. For each question, score your organization from 1-5:

1 = Not started
2 = Early experiments
3 = Defined approach
4 = Systematic implementation
5 = Optimized state

### People & Skills
- ____ To what extent has your organization identified which engineering roles will be most impacted by AI?
- ____ How well-defined are new roles and career paths for the AI-augmented engineering organization?
- ____ How comprehensive is your approach to reskilling engineers for AI collaboration?
- ____ How effectively are you recruiting for AI engineering capabilities?

**People & Skills Average Score: ____**

### Tooling & Stack
- ____ To what extent have you integrated AI coding assistants into your development environment?
- ____ How comprehensive is your strategy for AI-augmented development tools?
- ____ How mature is your approach to evaluating and adopting new AI engineering tools?
- ____ How effectively do you manage the security and compliance aspects of AI tools?

**Tooling & Stack Average Score: ____**

### Processes & Workflows
- ____ How thoroughly have you redesigned development processes to incorporate AI assistance?
- ____ To what extent have you automated routine engineering tasks using AI?
- ____ How well do your quality assurance processes address AI-generated code?
- ____ How effectively have you integrated AI into your planning and estimation processes?

**Processes & Workflows Average Score: ____**

### Governance & Ethics
- ____ How comprehensive are your policies for responsible AI use in engineering?
- ____ How well-defined is your approach to managing AI risks in the development process?
- ____ How robust is your framework for ensuring AI compliance with regulatory requirements?
- ____ How mature is your approach to ethical workforce transition as AI capabilities expand?

**Governance & Ethics Average Score: ____**

### Culture & Change Management
- ____ How effectively are you addressing engineer concerns about AI's impact on their roles?
- ____ How well does your organization's culture embrace AI as a collaborative tool?
- ____ How comprehensive is your change management approach for AI transformation?
- ____ How effectively do leaders model and champion AI adoption in engineering?

**Culture & Change Management Average Score: ____**

### Business Alignment
- ____ How clearly have you articulated the business case for AI engineering transformation?
- ____ How well do your AI engineering initiatives align with broader business objectives?
- ____ How effectively do you measure and communicate the business impact of AI adoption?
- ____ How mature is your approach to prioritizing AI investments based on business value?

**Business Alignment Average Score: ____**

## Interpreting Your Results

Calculate your average score for each dimension:

- **1.0-2.0**: Initial/Ad-hoc stage - Requires fundamental development of capabilities
- **2.1-3.0**: Developing stage - Building basic capabilities with room for formalization
- **3.1-4.0**: Defined stage - Established capabilities that need broader implementation
- **4.1-5.0**: Managed or Optimizing stage - Advanced capabilities ready for optimization

Focus your initial efforts on dimensions with the lowest scores, while leveraging strengths in your higher-scoring areas.

## Next Steps

After completing this initial assessment:

1. Review the detailed documentation for your lowest-scoring dimensions
2. Explore the [maturity model](maturity-model/README.md) for a more comprehensive assessment
3. Consider your industry context and review relevant [industry adaptations](adaptations/)
4. Develop a more detailed transformation roadmap using the [implementation guide](maturity-model/implementation.md)

Remember that AI engineering transformation is a journey that will evolve as AI capabilities advance. Start small, learn continuously, and adapt your approach based on results and emerging technologies.
